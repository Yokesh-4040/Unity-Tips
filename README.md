# 100 Days of Unity Tips

Welcome to my 100 Days of Unity Tips challenge! 🚀

In this repository, I will be sharing a new Unity tip every day for 100 days. These tips will cover a wide range of topics including coding, optimization, editor tools, and more.

## Structure

Each day has its own folder named `Day_XXX` containing a `README.md` with the tip details, code snippets, and resources.

## Progress

- [x] Day 001 - Avoiding Large Switch-Case Blocks

(You can update this list as you go!)
