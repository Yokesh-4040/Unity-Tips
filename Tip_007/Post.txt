Debugging in Unity goes beyond console logging - meet Debug.Break()!

While Debug.Log() tells you what happened, Debug.Break() pauses the Unity Editor at the exact moment it's called, letting you inspect your entire game state in real-time. Perfect for catching bugs as they happen, not after the fact.

Use it conditionally to pause when specific problems occur - invalid states, unexpected values, performance drops, or collision issues. Combined with IDE debuggers, it gives you complete visibility into your game's behavior.

I've documented practical examples including collision debugging, network validation, state machines, and performance monitoring here:
