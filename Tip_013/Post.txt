Need random points on a circle or sphere? There's a critical detail most developers miss.

Unity's Random.insideUnitCircle and Random.onUnitSphere handle the complex math of uniform distribution. But here's the gotcha: if you want points ON a circle's edge (not inside it), you MUST normalize before scaling. Otherwise you'll get points scattered throughout the interior.

This matters for: enemy spawners, particle systems, orbital mechanics, explosion debris, procedural scatter, shield effects—anywhere you need natural-looking randomization in 2D or 3D space.

I've documented the math behind it, 8 production examples, edge cases to handle, and common distribution patterns here:
