Stop littering your code with Debug.Log statements. There's a better way.

Right-click Unity's Inspector tab and switch to Debug mode. Instantly see ALL variables in your scripts—private fields, properties, computed values, cached references, even Unity's internal component data.

No more guessing if that Rigidbody is assigned. No more logging state machine transitions. No more temporary debug code that clutters your codebase. Just real-time visibility into everything happening under the hood.

Essential for: verifying null references, monitoring state machines, tracking object pools, debugging coroutines, inspecting singleton initialization—any time you need to see what's really going on inside your objects.

I've documented 7 production examples, advanced multi-inspector workflows, and the differences between Debug vs. Debug-Internal modes here:
