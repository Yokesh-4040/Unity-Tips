Stop writing for loops when you don't need the index.

Using foreach instead of for loops eliminates an entire class of bugs-off-by-one errors, index typos, unnecessary cognitive load. When you write foreach (Enemy enemy in enemies), the intent is crystal clear: you're processing all elements sequentially. No noise, no boilerplate, no room for index-related mistakes.

The choice between iteration patterns isn't about preference-it's about communicating intent. Use foreach when you only need elements. Use for when you need indices. Let the pattern itself document what you're doing.

I've documented practical examples and performance considerations here:
