Stop manually tracking transform changes in Unity - there's a built-in property for that!

Transform.hasChanged is a boolean flag that Unity automatically sets to true whenever a GameObject's position, rotation, or scale changes. This simple property eliminates the need for storing and comparing previous transform values, making your code cleaner and more efficient.

Perfect for optimizing UI updates, reducing network traffic, implementing dirty-flag patterns, and avoiding expensive calculations when objects haven't moved.
