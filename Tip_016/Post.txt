Stop writing `if (list != null && list.Count > 0)` everywhere.

C# property patterns let you express the same check as `if (list is { Count: > 0 })`-null-safe, concise, and crystal clear. The pattern matching syntax handles the null check implicitly while declaring exactly what shape of data you expect. It's not just shorter code; it's a shift from procedural checking to declarative intent.

I've documented practical examples and the full syntax breakdown here:
