Ever wondered why your kinematic rigidbody isn't detecting collisions with static walls or floors in Unity?

By default, Unity skips collision detection between kinematic rigidbodies and static colliders for performance optimization. But if you need this functionality for custom character controllers, moving platforms, or kinematic projectiles, there's a simple fix: enable "Enable Kinematic Static Pairs" in your Project Settings under Physics (or Physics 2D).

This project-wide setting unlocks collision events (OnCollisionEnter, OnCollisionStay, OnCollisionExit) between kinematic objects and static geometry, perfect for wall detection, environment interaction, and precise movement systems.

I've documented practical examples and performance considerations here:
