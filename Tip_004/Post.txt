Ever needed to find the closest point on a ray to any position in 3D space? This fundamental vector math technique is essential for AI pathfinding, cable physics, and projectile tracking!

By leveraging vector projection with the dot product, you can calculate exact proximity with just a few lines of code. This O(1) operation beats iterative sampling hands down and opens doors to elegant solutions for snap-to-line mechanics, distance checks, and spatial reasoning challenges.

I've documented practical examples including AI path following, rope physics, and projectile prediction systems here:
