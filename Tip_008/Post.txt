Make your Unity console debugging life more colorful with rich text markup!

Your console doesn't have to be a wall of plain text. Unity supports HTML-like tags in debug messages - add colors, bold, italics, and size variations to create visual hierarchy and instantly spot critical information.

Use `<color=red>` for errors, `<color=yellow>` for warnings, `<color=green>` for success messages, or hex codes for custom colors. Combine with `<b>` and `<i>` tags for maximum impact. Perfect for color-coding different systems, highlighting values, or creating severity-based logging.

I've documented practical examples including a complete DebugHelper utility class, system-specific logging, performance profiling, and state machine visualization here:
