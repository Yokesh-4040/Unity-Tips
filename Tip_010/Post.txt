Updating a score counter every frame? Using string concatenation like `text = "Score: " + score.ToString()` creates tons of garbage allocation that triggers frequent GC pauses and frame drops.

TextMeshPro's SetText() method is a game-changer. It formats numbers with zero garbage allocation by using internal buffers instead of creating new strings. Simply use `SetText("Score: {0}", score)` and you'll eliminate approximately 2.4 MB of garbage per minute in a typical game with 10 updating UI elements. Perfect for score displays, health bars, timers, FPS counters, and any rapidly changing numeric text.

I've documented practical examples, format specifiers, and performance benchmarks here:
